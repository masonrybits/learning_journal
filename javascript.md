# Script
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer follows in order to achieve a goal.

* To write a script, one needs to first define the goal, and then design the script by breaking down the goal into a series of steps, last code each step in a programming language that the computer understands. (Making a flowchart can be helpful).

# JavaScript

* JavaScript is an asynchronous, dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language, designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled.

* A script is made up of a series of statements that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each instruction is known as a **statement**.

* Javascript is case sensitive.

* **Comments** should be made to explain what the code does. This can be done by using either a **multi-line**, starting with the `/*` characters and ending with the `*/` characters or a **single-line**, by adding `//` characters before the line.

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. One can declare the variable, which involves creating the variable and giving it a name. For example, `var quantity;` indicates that `var` is the variable keyword, and `quantity` is the variable name. One can also assign a value to the variable. For example, `quantity = 2` indicates that the variable is assigned a value of 2. The equals sign `=` is an assignment operator. 

* Javascript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). The string is placed inside quote marks, either single or double quotes, but they must match.

# Expressions and Operators
* An **expression** evaluates into a single value. There are two types of expressions. One that just assigns a value to variable. And another that uses two or more values to return a single value.

* Expressions rely on **operators**, which allow creating a single value from one or more values.

# Functions
* Functions allow to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
* Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
* To create a function, one gives it a name and then write the statement needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is called a **function declaration**. For example, `function sayHello(){document.write('Hello');`} is a function with a function name `sayHello()` and code block in curly braces.
* Having declared the function, one can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is called **calling the function**.
