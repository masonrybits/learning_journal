# Computer
* There are 4 things common to all computers: **input**, **storage**, **processing** and **output**. Computers take input, stroe information, process it and then output the results.
* Computers represent numbers, words, images, and sound using the binary number system. Electric wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer by using the binary number system. They are the backbone of how computers input, store, process and output information. Computer circuits are microscopic nowadays. Electricity moves at just about the speed of light. Modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.
* In a computer, there are input devices that convert physical input to binary information. There is memory to store this information. There is CPU that calculates the information. And there are output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.
* CPU is a master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. Computer is able to run multiple software all at once. This utilizes the **operating system** that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. The operating system is able to switch between programs sharing the CPU for fractions of a second.
