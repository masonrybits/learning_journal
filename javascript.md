# Javascript

* Javascript is a scripting language used to enhance HTML pages and experience of interacting with the site. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. Javascript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. It is commonly found embedded in HTML code.

* A script is made up of a series of statements that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each instruction is known as a **statement**.

* Javascript is case sensitive.

* **Comments** should be made to explain what the code does. This can be done by using either a **multi-line**, starting with the `/*` characters and ending with the `*/` characters or a **single-line**, by adding `//` characters before the line.

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. One can declare the variable, which involves creating the variable and giving it a name. For example, `var quantity;` indicates that `var` is the variable keyword, and `quantity` is the variable name. One can also assign a value to the variable. For example, `quantity = 2` indicates that the variable is assigned a value of 2. The equals sign `=` is an assignment operator. 

* Javascript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). The string is placed inside quote marks, either single or double quotes, but they must match.
