# CSS

* CSS treats each HTML elements as if it appears inside its own box and allows to create rules that control the way each individual box and its contents look.

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. Rules are made up of **selectors** and **declaration**. Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. Declarations indicate how the elements should be styled. Declarations are made up of two parts: the **properties** and the **values** of those properties. For example, the rule `h1, h2 {font-family: arial; color: yellow;}` indicates that all h1 h2 elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color. The font-family and color are the properties, and the arial and yellow are the values.
