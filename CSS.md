# CSS

* CSS treats each HTML elements as if it appears inside its own box and allows to create rules that control the way each individual box and its contents look.

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. Rules are made up of **selectors** and **declaration**. Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. Declarations indicate how the elements should be styled. Declarations are made up of two parts: the **properties** and the **values** of those properties. For example, the rule `h1, h2 {font-family: arial; color: yellow;}` indicates that all h1 h2 elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color. The font-family and color are the properties, and the arial and yellow are the values.

# Color

* Color brings life to a site and provides contrast between any text and the background color

* There are many ways to pick a color in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and the color names

* Opacity can also be added to an element by using a RGBA value
